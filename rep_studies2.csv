Coley 1983,"The coevolutionary arms race between plants and herbivores has led to the evolution of thousands of defensive chemical compounds, including many used by humans as pharmaceuticals (e.g., quinine, taxol, opiates). This study demonstrated how plant characteristics interact with local environmental conditions in forests to influence these plant defenses; replicating it in other locations is critical to both refining plant evolutionary theory and improving bioprospecting for novel pharmaceutical or pesticide compounds.

Augspurger 1983,"Though this study was intended to test a fundamental theory explaining where seedlings become established, it also demonstrated fungal pathogens were an important and underappreciated mechanism influencing where seedlings became established. However, we know little about variation in pathogen effects at large scales or how climate change has altered their impacts, even for tree species that are central to community-based conservation strategies in the tropics (e.g., mahogany, Brazil nut). Replicating this study fill this data void."
Janzen 1967,"Over 300 species of tropical plants worldwide house ants in specialized structures in return for ants ferociously defending them against herbivores - an interaction that has fascinated naturalists since the early 1600s. This study, conducted in Central America with the tree genus Acacia, was the first to demonstrate unequivocally and experimentally that this was indeed a mutualism. Acacia are used by humans worldwide for timber and other uses and are critical stocks of carbon in African savannas; understanding why Acacia trees live or die has direct implications for individual livelihoods and conservation strategies. However, perhaps this study’s greatest impact was in demonstrating ant-plant systems are ideal ones for experimentally studying the structure, breakdown, and recovery of mutualistic interactions in ways that are impossible with other mutualist systems (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal). Replicating this study will have impacts that extend beyond the conservation of this ecologically and economically critical species - it will allow ecologists to infer how human activities have affected other mutualisms that provide critical ecosystem services."
Marquis 1984,"This study was one of the first to show that herbivory can lead directly to reduced seed production in plants. Consequently, subsequent studies modeling the long-term viability of endangered plant species or those harvested for use by humans have usually incorporated either direct or indirect measurements of herbivory or its impact.  Replicating this study will help assess under what circumstances these labor-intensive and challenging measurements are actually necessary."
"Chazdon and Fetcher 1984,  Kitajima 1984","The limited amount of sunlight reaching the understory of tropical forests - less than 2 percent - is the factor limiting the growth and survivorship of forest plants. These studies mapped understory light levels and documented how plants respond physiologically to variation in the light environment. Though considered seminal, they have yet to be replicated. Consequently, it remains poorly understood how altered forest structure resulting from deforestation or drought changes forest microclimate and how plants respond to these changes."
Ewel 1976,"40 percent of the world’s tropical forests are not “primary forest”, but rather “successional” forest regenerating in areas abandoned after agriculture or deforestation. How these areas were used prior to being abandoned strongly influences nutrient cycling in regenerating forests, which in turn influences their species diversity and hence capacity to sequester carbon. Replicating this study globally will provide the most robust data to date on these issues, informing the principal international policy mechanisms for promoting forest conservation"
"Denslow 1980 , Gentry and Dobson 1987 , Jankowski et al 2009 , Ryan et al 1983","These studies were fundamental in describing how 1000s of species are able to coexist in tropical ecosystems when presumably competing for the same resources. Revisiting their conclusions is essential in light of the myriad ways tropical ecosystems are being altered, since most conservation policies are based on the original results. For instance, deforestation and droughts increase forest disturbance, which can cause species that thrive in them to increase in abundance while others go extinct (Denslow, Gentry). Similarly, warming climates are predicted to cause species found only at high elevations to be pushed “off mountaintops” to extinction. Finally, the interaction of changing landscapes and climates can influence animal behavior responsible for mating success; without understanding changes in species behavior, abundance, and distribution it is impossible to design conservation and management plans to proactively protect threatened biodiversity.

"Bruna 1999 , Carvalho and Vasconcelos 1999 , Holl 1999 , Menke et al. 2012",Deforestation and the resulting isolation of ‘islands’ of forest surrounded by agriculture is possibly the leading cause of extinction in the tropics. The following studies have provided some of the most important and widely-applied insights to date on how plants and animals that remain in these forest fragments are influenced by the dramatic changes to their environment. Replication - especially in the understudied forests of equatorial Africa - will help ensure that the results of these studies are truly applicable to other regions or if resources are better allocated to mitigating the impacts of deforestation on other species and ecological processes.
